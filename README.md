# AP-HealthCare-Insurance
CS244 Data Science Project

## Project Instuctions
- Every group has to submit their work up to “e. Hypothesis Testing” before mid sem and complete work till the end sem.
- Every group will have to create a slide and a video and upload it to youtube in which each member of the respective group has to present his/her contribution.
- There are no limits on the number of slides, but each teammate has to present his/her part.
- Make sure that during the video recording, your face is clearly visible along with the slide you are presenting. (Just text with audio will not be accepted.)
- Any kind of interesting facts about data(e.g., kind of different studies which can be done using the collected data), innovative ideas, and/or research ideas (Manipulation or enhancements of existing techniques for better results) will also be considered during evaluation and will be highly appreciated.
- In case of any discrepancy, please discuss with your allotted TA i.e Saurabh Sharma, [saurabh_2021CS30@iitp.ac.in](mailto:saurabh_2021CS30@iitp.ac.in)

## Group 35 - Project P20
Welcome to the CS244 Data Science Project - "AP-HealthCare-Insurance," presented by Group 35. In this project, we explore and analyze health insurance data from Andhra Pradesh to derive valuable insights and predictions. We have organized our work into multiple phases and deliverables, ensuring a comprehensive and insightful project presentation.

### Project Phases and Deliverables

#### Tasks
By the end-semester, we aim to cover the following project phases:

1. **Data Collection:** We have meticulously gathered relevant data for our analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:** Our data has undergone thorough cleaning and preprocessing.
3. **Data Visualization:** We've created insightful visualizations to aid in data understanding.
4. **Data Statistics:** A comprehensive summary of the data's statistics.
5. **Hypothesis Testing:** We've formulated and executed hypothesis tests for our research.
6. **Prediction Task:** Utilizing machine learning models for predictive analysis.

#### Deliverables for Mid Semester:
- A 10-minute project presentation video.
- A summary PDF.
- Presentation slides.
